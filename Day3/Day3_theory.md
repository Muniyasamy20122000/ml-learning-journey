#Linear Regression - Key Points

**Definition:**
Linear Regression is a Supervised ML algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent vairable(Y) and one or more independent vairables(X) by fitting a linear equation.

**Formula (Simple Linear Regression):**
Y = mX + c

**Where:**
- Y = Dependent variable (prediction/output)
- X = Independent variable (input)
- m = slope of the line (how much Y changes for each unit change in X)
- c = Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)

**Use Cases:**
- Predicting house prices based on area
- Estimating salary based on years of experience
- Forecasting sales based on advertising spend

**Types**
- Simple Linear Regression: One Independent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: More than one independent variable.
