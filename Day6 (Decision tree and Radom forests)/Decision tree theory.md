** #Decision Trees**

**Definition:**
- A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
- Splits data into branches like a tree until it reaches a decision.

**How it works (intuition):**
- Choose a feature and split that best separates classes or predicts values.
- Uses criteria like Gini impurity, Entropy, or MSE.

**Terminology:**
- Root node: First split.
- Internal nodes: Further splits.
- Leaf nodes: Final prediction classes/values.
- Depth: Levels in the tree.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to understand and interpret
- Handles numerical and categorical data.
- No feature scaling needed.

**Disadvantages:**
- Prone to overfitting
- Small change in data -> different trees.
