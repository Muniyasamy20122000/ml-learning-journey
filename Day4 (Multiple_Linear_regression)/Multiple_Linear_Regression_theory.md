**#Multiple Linear Regression**

**Definition:**
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It models the relationship between one dependent variable(Y) and two or more independent variabls(X1, X2, ..., Xn).

**Formula:**
Y = m1*X1 +m2*X2 + ... + mn*Xn + c

Where:
- Y = Dependent variable (output)
- X1, X2, ..., Xn = Independent variables (inputs)
- m1, m2, ..., mn = coeffcients (slopes) for each input variable
- c = Intercept

**Use Cases:**
- Predicting house prices based on area, number of bedrooms, and location
- Estimating salary based on years of experience, education level, and age
- Predicting sales based on advertising spend across TV, radio, and newspaper

**Key Points:**
- All independent variables are assumed to have linear relationships with Y.
- Helps understand combined effect of multiple factors on a single outcome.
