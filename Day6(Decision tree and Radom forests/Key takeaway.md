#Key Takeaways#

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that:
- Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
- Increases model robustness by combining multiple trees.

Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression with:
- slightly higher accuracy
- Better precision and recall for malignant class (critical in cancer detection)
- Reduced overfitting risk due to ensemble averaging.
