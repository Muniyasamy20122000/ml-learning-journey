# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM finds the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes(like benign vs. malignant tumors) of data with the maximum margin.

**Why Use SVM?**
- Works great on both linear and non-linear data
- Uses kernel tricks to handle complex boundaries
- Often gives high accuracy with small data
