# Day 2 - ML Theory Notes

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of ML
1. **Supervised Learning** - learning with labelled data to predict outcomes.
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - learning from unlabelled data to find patterns or clusters.
3. **Reinforcement Learning** - learning through rewards and penalties by interacting with an environment.
